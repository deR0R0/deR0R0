*feel the inner peace. we are not going to rage at git*

# 👋 Welcome
I'm Robert Zhao, currently a high school student @ TJHSST. I'm quite busy right now, but you'll see me pop around some Github repos. Check out my sick [website](https://robertzhao.dev) by the way!

# 🎯 Goals/Current Mission
1. I'm currently learning C++ as I'm trying to get into competitive programming.
2. Also planning on learning some game dev stuff.

I'm just trying to survive TJ and expand my skills beyond the horizon. (funny joke because of the sunset!)

# 🎯 Skills

## Languages
Python, Java, Web Dev (HTML, CSS), JS/TS, C++, C#, Arduino

## OS
MacOS, Windows, Ubuntu (linux)

# 🛠️ Notable Projects
While some of these projects aren't open-sourced, they're still pretty cool!

## [CaliforniaBoombox](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/RoroMods/CaliforniaBoombox/)
CaliforniaBoombox is a Lethal Company mod I made in 2023 that's kinda just a stupid mod. It replaces the boombox sounds with California Gurls by Katy Perry (because of the memes at that time). Some technologies I used for this project were: IlSpy (decompiler to view source code), BepInEx (for the injector), Unity (to make the sound file into a unity asset file), and C# (language). This mod has 13k+ downloads (on thunderstore)!

## [SSSnac-Time](https://github.com/deR0R0/sssnac-time)
SSSnac-Time is a snake game made in Java Swing. This project was made for my Computer Science final project, and I wanted to make something that demonstrated everything I had learned in that class. I took heavy inspiration from the Google snake and it's smooth animations (although, i couldn't finish it by the deadline). The technologies I used for this project were: Swing (gui graphics) and Java (language).

## [SSTimer](https://github.com/deR0R0/sstimer)
SSTimer is an overlay app for League of Legends that allows for players to manually track summoner spell timers. I saw many videos of Youtubers using these types of apps (like porofessor, etc) where they had the spell timers. Although, when I tried to use them, it would lag my computer very hard and use ~400MB RAM including Overwolf. I decided I wanted to create a lighter solution (but I used electron.js...) and open source it. I mostly succeeded in this: my FPS wouldn't drop from 144 -> 90 (but instead drop from 144 -> 120 with my app) and memory usage dropped to 120 MB.
