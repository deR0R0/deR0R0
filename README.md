# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome
I'm Robert Zhao, current a high school student @ TJHSST. I'm quite busy right now, but you'll see me pop around some Github repos. Check out my sick [website](https://robertzhao.dev) by the way!

# ðŸŽ¯ Goals/Current Mission
1. I'm currently learning C++ as I'm trying to get into competitive programming.
2. Also planning on learning some game dev stuff.

I'm just trying to survive TJ and expand my skills beyond the horizon. (funny joke because of the sunset!)
