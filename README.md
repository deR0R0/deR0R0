# 👋 Introduction
I'm Robert Zhao, currently a high school student @ TJHSST. I'm quite busy right now, but you'll see me pop around some Github repos. Check out my sick [website](https://robertzhao.dev).

# 🎯 Goals/Current Mission
1. Learning C++ through game development.
2. Finding opportunities to demonstrate my skills in a real-world work environment.

# 🎯 Skills

## Languages
Python, Java, Web Dev (HTML, CSS), JS/TS, C++, C#, Arduino

## Frameworks
Next.js, Electron.js, Tauri, Swing

## OS
MacOS, Windows, Ubuntu (linux)

# 🛠️ Notable Projects
While some of these projects aren't open-sourced, they're still pretty cool!

## [CaliforniaBoombox](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/RoroMods/CaliforniaBoombox/)
CaliforniaBoombox was created because I wanted a mod that added this meme music to the game. I thought through implementation: did I want to create a custom item for such a simple mod or should I just simply replace the audio of a pre-existing item in the game? I chose the second option since it's also client-sided and doesn't require the server to have the mod installed too, reducing capatability nightmares!

## [SSSnac-Time](https://github.com/deR0R0/sssnac-time)
SSSnac-Time was created for my Computer Science Foundations final project. I wanted to mimic the Google snake's gameplay smoothness and I (semi) succeeded. If I had more time to work on this project, I would fix the animations and such to make it feel a lot more "connected" and not jumbled pieces of images.

## [SSTimer](https://github.com/deR0R0/sstimer)
SSTimer was created because I wanted to use apps like Porofessor, etc, but all these apps do is load a bunch of ads on your PC, ultimately slowing it down and reducing FPS. I programmed SSTimer with efficiency in mind (I did not succeed since Electron.js is too heavy! Still a cool project though), more specifically, RAM and CPU. CPU was easy since I wasn't loading ads on the user's PC and RAM was a little difficult since most of the RAM used was by the heavy Chromnium processes.
